        <p>
                I am the Co-Owner and Creative director of NonQuixote LLC, a Brand Storytelling and Production Company. I pursued filmmaking at university and am learning to code so I can better create VR experiences. I am an Award-winning filmmaker including an Emmy Nomination for best cinematography and my films have premiered at the New York Film Festival, AFI Docs, Miami Basel, and the Slamdance Film Festival. In my spare time, I craft short stories and talismans into cards that I share with others. Since making films takes such a long time, conveying simple ideas with a card allows me to simplify the world and how I see it.</p>
